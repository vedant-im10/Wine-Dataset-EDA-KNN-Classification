# Wine-Dataset-EDA-KNN-Classification
This project focuses on exploring the Wine dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and applying the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification. The project investigates the bias-variance tradeoff by tuning the hyperparameter k and visualizes how changes in k affect decision boundaries.
